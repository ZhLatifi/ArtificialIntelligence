Python Codes for AUT Artificial Intelligence Course

This repository houses my solutions to the Artificial Intelligence course projects at Amirkabir University of Technology.
Below, you'll find a list of project titles, each one an exploration of AI concepts and applications:
1. Designing an agent for the Roulette game with Minimax & Expectimax algorithms, Using alpha-beta pruning, Defining an evaluation function
2. Guidance of an agent in a world-grid environment using Reinforcement Learning algorithms
3. Implementation of the "Snake" game using the Deep Q-Learning technique
